# IGSR Data (The International Genome Sample Resource)

The 1000 Genomes Project created a catalogue of common human genetic variation, using openly consented samples from people who declared themselves to be healthy. The reference data resources generated by the project remain heavily used by the biomedical science community.

# Pharm CAT (Pharmacogenomics Clinical Annotation Tool)
PharmCAT (Pharmacogenomics Clinical Annotation Tool) is a bioinformatics tool that analyzes genetic variants to predict drug response and tailor medical treatment to an individual patient’s genetic profile.
It takes patient genetic data (VCF file) and produces a pharmacogenomic clinical report based on CPIC guidelines + PharmGKB annotations.
