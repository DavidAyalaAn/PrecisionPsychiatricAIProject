This personal project originated as an idea before I embarked on my journey to learn artificial intelligence. It became the catalyst that solidified my decision to change careers, providing the clarity and motivation I needed to leave my previous role. Today, it stands as both a milestone and a guiding objective for applying the knowledge I will gain throughout my studies.

# Problem

Advances in medical technology have given rise to precision medicine, which tailors treatments to individual patients using specific data such as genetic profiles. This approach aims to increase treatment effectiveness while minimizing side effects.

In psychiatry, a parallel field--precision psychiatry--remains needed of more effort in development.
Compared to precision medicine, there are far fewer projects in this area, and the research challenges are more complex due to the evolving nature of psychiatric knowledge.

Many people with psychiatric conditions achieve only partial remission after extensive psychological and pharmacological treatments. Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is one example of a particularly challenging condition. Its high comorbidity with other disorders—such as depression, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, and PTSD—makes it difficult to study in isolation. Although my primary focus will be on BPD, the methodologies I develop may also apply to related conditions.

# Project Approach

This project does not aim to propose new treatments or solutions. Instead, it will explore various AI techniques—such as machine learning on genetic data, neuropsychological test results, and other medical datasets—within sort of a context of informal precision psychiatry. The dual purpose of this effort is to strengthen my understanding of AI concepts and potentially uncover novel ideas or tools that could benefit the field.

I plan to progress incrementally, starting with foundational studies and small-scale experiments. As I build knowledge and confidence, I will tackle more complex analyses and larger datasets.
